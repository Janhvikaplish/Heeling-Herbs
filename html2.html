<p style="font-size: 200%"><b>The Secret</b> to everything in this universe is <b>Believing In Yourself</b> and <b>Being Grateful</b> for the things you have. Everything is possible in this world, it just requires <b>Belief</b> and <b>Confidence</b> in <b>YOURSELF</b>.   </p>

<p style="font-size: 180%" title="This para tells the importance of gratitude">Gratitude is the practice of noticing and appreciating the positives in the world (particularly in your own personal world). Shifting the focus from what you don't have to what you do have can have a profound influence on your moment-to-moment mood and emotional state, and it can have a huge impact on your physical health, as well. In fact, there is a burgeoning field of research -- positive psychology -- devoted to looking at the contributing factors of happiness and well-being.</p>

<P style="font-size: 180%" title="This para tells the importance of believing in yourself">Most of the time, the difference in whether you have succeeded in your life or not comes down to one simple thing that is believing in yourself. If you can’t believe that you can do something, you can never give your 100% to do that job, and in the end, the chances of your success get hugely affected. Besides, believing in yourself also activates the positive energy that plays an essential role in making you strong and focused on your work. If you don’t believe in yourself and your dreams, and if you ever need to convince others, you can never make them believe in you and your dream.
